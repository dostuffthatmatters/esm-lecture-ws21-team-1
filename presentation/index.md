## LFU - Air Quality Data Archive

-   $\text{NO}_2$, $\text{PM}_{10}$, $\text{PM}_{2.5}$, $\text{O}_{3}$, $\text{CO}$, ...
-   52 Stations in Bavaria
-   Hourly data = `8760` data points per station per year
-   Since 1980 (not all stations over the whole timespan)

<br/>

**Data Source:** https://www.lfu.bayern.de/luft/immissionsmessungen/messwertarchiv

"Daten" -> "Luft" -> "Messwertarchiv"

I will talk about the data license at the end.

### LFU - Data Preparation

1. Replace cells like `?`, `#` or nothing in it with `NaN`
2. Remove locations not of interest
3. Merge all data into one CSV file

<!--

Optional:
Last signal from PrinzregentenstraÃŸe: 20120208
Last signal from Moosach: 20130709

-->

---

In the following I will only look at **data between 2010 and now** and the station **at Landshuter Allee** from $\textbf{NO}_\textbf{2}$ **concentrations**.

---

![h:500 bg](../implementation/renders/images/alltime_weekly_cycle.png)

---

**Findings:**

-   Daily and weekly cycle
-   Shape of cycle did not change since 2010
-   Average concentration has been reduced by 40-50% since 2010

<br/>

**Next Question:** Is there a trend by month - certain months with low/high concentrations.

<!--

Since the concentration goes down over the years we should only look at years separately.

We picked 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (the 4 years before the current pandemic).

-->

![h:700 bg](../implementation/renders/videos/weekly_cycle_colored_by_month.gif)

<!--
The concentration seems to go down in the winter months and tends to rise during summer.

<!--

In a still image this can be seen more clearly. But I made the GIF and wanted to show it too ;)

I down know why the concentration goes down during winter. I actually did assume with many people on vacation in summer the concentrations should be lower.

Something not uncommon in data science: You assume something and find out that the opposite is true.

-->

---

**Findings:**

-   Concentration in summer months tends to be higher than in winter months in the observed period

<br/>

**Next Question:** Is there a correlation between weather and concentration.

<!--

LAST QUESTION we want to visit here.

Assumption: People use cars more often when it is cold or when it is raining, i.e. higher concentrations.

## DWD - German Climatedata Archive

-   Mean temperature, mean pressure, sunshine hours, ...
-   83 stations in Germany
-   Daily data
-   **Munich Airport** data since 1992

<br/>

**Data Source:** https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/klarchivtagmonat ("DWD - Klimadaten Deutschland - Monats- und Tageswerte (Archiv)")

<!--

The DWD website's organization is rather messy so I won't show picture of how you get there. Here is the Link and the name of that archive.

<!--

This GIF is again looping over all the years.

The good thing: We see a correlation between wind speed and concentration. Higher wind speed -> lower concentration. Molecules get transported away faster.

The interesting thing here is that there is no correlation between temperature/precipitation and concentration.

Argument for using a car: "Less people want to use a bike or public transport when it is cold or wet raining"

**Do these findings disprove this argumentation?** Is the reason for using a car really the weather or is it mainly habit and each individuals situation?

If you want to use the same data, here is the link to our open source code which does this preparation and analysis.

Will be open source after 3pm ;)
